# no_file_limit ðŸ“‚
A tool to work around annoying file limits on platforms like Discord and WhatsApp.

## There's nothing here yet...
It's currently exam season so there's no time for this project, but I will hopefully return to this idea afterwards. For the sender, the program will cut files into viarably-sized chunks (8MB for Discord, 100MB for WhatsApp), and produce a metadata file for the receiver. All the receiver has to do is open the metadata file and it will stitch together the original file from the chunks.
